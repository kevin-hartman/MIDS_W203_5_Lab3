    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we seek to examine and discuss determinants of crime and offer recommend actionable policy recommendations for local politicians running for election at the county level. For our analysis, we draw on sample data collected from a study by Cornwell and Trumball, researchers from the University of Georgia and West Virginia University. Our sample data includes data on crime rates, arrests, sentences,  demographics, local weekly wages, tax revenues and more drawn from local and federal government data sources. Although the age of the data may be a potential limitation of our study, we believe the insights we gather and policy recommendations remain appropriate for local campaigns today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our primary question that will drive our data exploration are to ask which variables affect crime rate the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The crime_v2 dataset provided includes 25 variables of interest. \n",

    "We include them below for reference by category of interest.\n",

    "The variables above operationalize the conditions we wish to explore and their affects on crime rate\n",
    "\n",
    "Chiefly, these break down as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Economic variables measures the county's economic activity and health (e.g. opportunity to pursue legal forms of income). These variables come in the form of available wages and tax revenue returned to the county.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Law enforcment variables measures the county's ability to utilize law enforcment policy to deter crime.  Similarly, the Judicial variables also signify impact of deterence to crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Demographic variables measure the cultural variability that represent the social differences between each county, such as urban vs rural and minority populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Geographic elements are categorical. They  represent they ways in which the population is segmented by geography.\n",

    "In this model, we introduce the additional covariates of population per square mile (density), tax per capita (taxpc) and police per capita (polpc) to increase the accuracy of our regression. We are including these additional variables to our second model, as they add accuracy to the explanatory variables used in our first model:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **DENSITY** of an area can have significant impacts on:\n",
    "    - **Criminal Justice Effectiveness**: with more people in a given area, crime frequency increases (+ bias direction). However, more people means there are more potential witnesses, making it easier to catch criminals (- bias direction). \n",
    "    - **Economic Opportunity (ie. AllWages)**: in high density areas, there is an increase in demand for support services such as food, retail, utilities, etc. As a result, there is a high demand for service jobs, which increases the economic opportunities within the area (+ bias direction).  However, more people in a given area, there is a closer proximity to drugs, alcohol and gang violence - all of which are inhimitors to better economic outcomes. \n",
    "2. The **Police Per Capita** in a county can be influential on the Criminal Justice Effectiveness. With more police in a given area, one would think that crime rates would decrease, however our correlation plot below tells a different story. Including this variable in our analysis will give us more insight into the variables used in model 1. \n",
    "3. The **Tax Per Capita** can have a direct impact on the Police Per Capita. A higher tax per capita, means that the county has more tax dollars to spend on protection services (ie. increasing the number of police in the county). \n",

    "\n",
    "One key component of demographics is the race of the county inhabitants and how they are perceived and treated by others, especially for minorities in the population.  For example, systemic racism could have an important effect on: \n",
    "* Criminal Justice Effectiveness: If police, lawyers and judges are racially biased, this could lead to more arrests and more convictions regardless of the strength of the legal case and the evidence. As a result, we hypothesize the crime rate would increase.\n",
    "* Economic Opportunity: Racism could prohibit members of the minority from having access to education, jobs and higher wages. Racism could also limit access to healthcare and social programmes which has a negative effect on economic opportunity. \n",
    "    \n",
    "However, since we cannot directly measure racism, we have to operationalize this covariate by examining its effect in the real world. We propose to use the variable pctmin80, which represents the percentage of minorities in the population of the county. This is a good indicator that is also a linear parameter: given a higher the percentage of minorities, we should expect to see a greater effect. \n",

    "* Urban: We believe the variable \"density\" better explains the same effects as \"urban\", while also being a linear parameter. In addition, there may be data points that failed to meet the cutoff for being defined as urban, but may still see the same effects as being urban and hence may distort our analysis.\n",
    "* Age and Gender: While age and gender are important demographic variables, the only variable in our dataset is pctymle which provides the percentage of young males in the population. However, given that this variable encompasses both male and young, we may not be able to discern if age or gender has the larger effect (if any at all). \n",

It is expected that it would be negatively correlated with criminal justice effectiveness as large social pressures prevent witnesses from supporting prosecution.

    "In Model 3, we were able to explain up to 73% of the variation in our data, and found statistical significance at the 95% level or better for each of our covariates. Of these, we believe that increasing the efficiency of the criminal justice system and tax revenues were the most important, particularly for counties with high density and minority populations. However, our findings should be noted with caution as we were unable to study the effect of several ommitted variables including education, availability of social services, unemployment rates and the presence of organized crime. Had we been able to collect data on these variables and apply them in our model, we believe we could increase accuracy without bias."
