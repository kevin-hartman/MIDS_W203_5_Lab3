    "The 4 major identified ommited variables are shown above. \n",
    "* Education is an important variable because of demographic insights it provides.  First, adults with higher education are less likely to participate in Crime and are more likely to have better economic opportunity. Second, a strong school system is also likely correlated with less youth crime.  Because of these expected correlations we are likely overestimating the economic conditions coefficient estimate. \n",
    "* Available Social Services could also lower crime.  Citizens with strong social services support have more options to get help when they lack means for purchasing basic life needs.  However this is more difficult to predict, as some social service projects, like homeless shelters, could lead to more criminal activity.\n",
    "* Unemployment is used as an important indicator of economic health and opportunity.  This is would be highly correlated to economic conditions variables like sum of wages.  This indicator variable if added to the model would decrease the magnitude of the sum of wage means coefficient estimate.  \n",
    "* Gang Crime is special case of crime that contains unique causes.  It is expected that it would be negatively correlated with criminal justice effectiveness as large social pressures prevent witnesses from supporting prosecution.  Gang crime is also negatively correlated with economic conditions.  From these assumed correlations, we can say that criminal justice effectiveness and economic conditions are both underestimated compared to including gang activity operationalized variable in the model."
